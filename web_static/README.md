In this Project we will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages.

* In 0-index.html: we use inline styling.
* In 1-index.html: We replace the inline styling with the style tag in head.
* In 2-index.html: We use CSS files for styling.
* In 3-index.html: We add a logo, tab icon and update the page styling.
* In 4-index.html: we add the search section with a button.
